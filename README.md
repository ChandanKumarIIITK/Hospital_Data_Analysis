# Hospital_Data_Analysis

## Project Objective:
This project aims to analyze hospital data using Excel and Power BI, focusing on patient flow, billing trends, bed occupancy, diagnosis patterns, and doctor feedback. The objective is to derive meaningful insights for operational improvements in hospital management.

# Power BI Questions:
1. What is the distribution of bed occupancy across different hospital units?
2. How do diagnosis types vary in frequency?
3. What is the trend between billing amounts and health insurance claims?
4. Which doctors received the highest volume of feedback?
5. What are the key discharge and follow-up patterns?

## Process of the Project
1. Data Collection & Cleaning : Imported hospital dataset from Excel.Cleaned missing values and formatted data for analysis.
2. Data Analysis & Visualization : Built interactive dashboards in Power BI.Created charts, graphs, and KPIs to visualize trends.Used DAX calculations for deeper insights.

## Project Insights
1. Bed Occupancy: Private wards have the highest occupancy.
2. Diagnosis Trends: Fractures and viral infections are common cases.
3. Billing vs. Insurance: There is a correlation between billing amounts and insurance claims, with pneumonia having lower coverage.
4. Doctor Feedback: All doctors received uniform feedback volumes (~1.02K each).

## Learning Experience
1. Hands-on experience with Power BI dashboards and DAX functions.
2. Improved data cleaning, visualization, and analytical skills.
3. Gained insights into healthcare data analytics and business intelligence.

## Project Conclusion
This analysis highlights key hospital operational metrics, helping in resource allocation, financial planning, and patient care improvement. The dashboard serves as a real-time decision-making tool for healthcare management.
